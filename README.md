### Examples:

Given a prompt: "Who did I talk to at [x company]?"

The traditional search doesn't give any results.

The semantic search engine opens up an email thread with the person I spoke to at [x company].


---

Given a prompt: "Find me some free food coupons"

The traditional search doesn't give any results.

The semantic search engine opens up a recent email with a $25 Uber Eats Coupon!

---

Given a prompt: "I want to learn about how AI is used in healthcare."

The traditional search finds an email with an article about AI in the robotics industry, but it doesn't mention healthcare at all.

The semantic search engine opens a email with a link to a Stanford video seminar titled “Understanding the Future of Medicine: Generative AI”.
